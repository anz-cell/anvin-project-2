3. **Navigate to `public_html`** folder (this is your website root)
4. **Upload ALL files** to the `public_html` directory:

```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── contact.html
├── about.html
├── mainland.html
├── freezone.html

├── simple-newsletter.php  ← IMPORTANT!

```

### **Method 2: FTP Client**

1. **Download FileZilla** (free FTP client)
2. **Get FTP credentials** from your hosting provider
3. **Connect to your server**
4. **Upload all files** to the root directory (usually `public_html`)

- View contact form submissions (mvgrrqov)
- View newsletter subscriptions (xkgbbzgq)

### **Email Logs:**

- Your server will create `newsletter_log.txt`

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Newsletter Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check PHP support** - ensure hosting supports PHP
2. **Check file permissions** - `simple-newsletter.php` should be readable
3. **Check error logs** - look in hosting control panel
4. **Test Formspree** - should work even if email fails

### **If Contact Form Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check Formspree status** at https://formspree.io
2. **Verify form ID** - should be `mvgrrqov`
3. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors

### **Common Issues:**

- **405 Error:** PHP not supported (upgrade hosting)
- **500 Error:** File permissions or PHP syntax
- **No emails:** Check spam folder, verify Gmail settings
